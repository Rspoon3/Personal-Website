  "description": "On March 25, 2019 Apple held an event announcing it’s new services plans. This included Apple Card. I thought that the card and application associated with it looked very interesting. As a jr developer I was intrigued with how they might have coded the UI. As such, I was intrigued and very much wanted to get the card and explore the app that came with it. Unfortunately it was announced that it wouldn’t be be available until this summer. Not to be deterred I thought I would make my own version of the Apple Card App! This is just a simulation of what I expected Apple’s final application to look and feel like. The entire thing was based off the videos and photos that the company has released to the public. I have no information about the actual application or card. This is entirely an interactive UI mock up."
