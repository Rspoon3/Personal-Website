# Cinematic

Cinematic lets you browse which movies are playing, the most popular, upcoming, and the most top rated movies of all time. With full iOS 13 and iPad support, it looks gorgeous in both light and dark mode. With a clean and intuitive UI, everything is easy to find and use. Check different categories, search for any movie, and save your favorites to your own personal collection. With Cinematic, movies have never looked so good.

# Behind the Scenes

Cinematic is a fun personal project that is starting to blur the lines between a production app and a hobbiest project. It was born in 2018 as a resume/portfolio piece. Since then it has become my test bed for iOS development. A lot of the technologies that I end up putting into my production apps start here. With this app I have experimented with pure SwiftUI, UIKIt with SwiftUI integration, Combine, UICollectionview Diffable Data Source, and UICollectionview Flow Layout- just to name a few! Cinematic also serves as a great platform to advnace my swift skills by testing out any new techniques I learn. Additionally I get to test out new designs, both in the application and for promotions- which is why this entire website exists.

In the future I look forward to continuing working on this an tacking on new cool technologies. If you're interested in following along with the development, check out the GitHub Page and follow me on Twitter.
