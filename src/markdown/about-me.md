# About Me

I'm a full time iOS developer outside of Boston who works full time at [Fetch Rewards](https://fetch.com/) and occasionally dables with creating and updating my own apps. I've been developing for Apple's platforms since 2017 and absolutely love it. I find my career to be incredibly rewarding and the iOS community is amazing. I look forward to seeing what my future can be.

## Hobbies

When I'm not writing code, you can find me working out, riding my motorcyles, hiking, reading, and spending quality time with my partner and dog.
