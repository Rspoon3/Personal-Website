# About Me

I'm a full time iOS developer outside of Boston who works full time at [InterPro Solutions](https://interprosoft.com/), works on client projects, and likes to create my own apps. I've been developing for Apple's platforms since 2017 and absolutely love it. I find my career to be incredibly rewarding and the iOS community is amazing. I look forward to seeing what my future can be.

## Hobbies

When I'm not writing code, you can find me hiking, riding my motorcyles, on a beach, and shredding down the mountain if it's cold enough. If you ski, we can't be friends. Joking. Mostly.
